<h2>玄彬虽然帅，但是我还是更喜欢Daniel Kahneman，没读两页就有很多想要记录下来。</h2>
<p>Questioning what we believe and want is difficult at the best of times, and especially difficult when we most need to do it, but we can benefit from the informed opinions of others.</p>
<p>A deeper understanding of judgments and choices also requires a richer vocabulary than is available in everyday language.</p>
<p>We were far too willing to believe research findings based on inadequate evidence and prone to collect too few observations in our own research. 是的，人真的很容易相信不够具有统计有效性的发现😔</p>
<p>Because public interest is most easily aroused by dramatic events and by celebrities, media feeding frenzies are common.  哎😑 最近的疫情不就是吗</p>
<p>A recurrent theme of this book is that luck plays a large role in every story of success; it is almost always easy to identify a small change in the story that would have turned a remarkable achievement into a mediocre outcome. </p>
<p>...a puzzling limitation of our mind; our excessive confidence in what we believe we know, and our apparent inability to acknowledge the full extent of our ignorance and the uncertainty of the world we live in. We are prone to overestimate how much we understand about the world and to underestimate the role of chance events. <br></p><h2>Laziness is built deep into our nature<br></h2>
<p>&lt;Attention and effort&gt; p35<br>
As you become skilled in a task, its demand for energy diminishes. &lsqb;...&rsqb; Talent has similar effects. &lsqb;...&rsqb; A general “law of least effort” applies to cognitive as well as physical exertion. The law asserts that if there are several ways of achieving the same goal, people will eventually gravitate to the least demanding course of action. In the economy of action, effort is cost, and the acquisition of skill is driven by the balance of benefits and costs. Laziness is built deep into our nature.</p><h2>The lazy controller <br></h2>
<p>&lt;chapter 4&gt;<br>
<ul>
<li>...self control requires attention and effort.<br>
<li>...all variants of voluntary effort - cognitive, emotional, or physical - draw at least partly on the same pool of mental energy. <br>
<li>...the idea of mental energy is more than a mere metaphor. The nervous system consumes more glucose than most other parts of the body, and effortful mental activity appears to be especially expensive in the currency of glucose.<br>
<li>...a recurrent theme of this book: many people are overconfident, prone to place too much faith in their intuitions. They apparently find cognitive effort at least mildly unpleasant and avoid it as much as possible. <br>
<li>Intelligence is not only the ability to reason; it is also the ability to find relevant material in memory and to deploy attention when needed.</p>
</ul>
<p>这一点最近深有体会，注意力越来越难集中，这样不好。要改正。</p><h2>The associative machine (ch4)<br></h2>
<p>Kahneman uses an example of banana and vomit to discuss the automatic responses of system 1 where associative activation takes place. This is interesting and also a bit foreign, because I realized that I don’t experience that whole complex of responses when the words are in a foreign language. When I tried to recreate the scenario but with the words in my native language, the responses are more automatic and intense. It’s interesting how  different systems are triggered when signals are presented in different languages. It seems that system 2 (the more effortful one) is more often used when faced with a non-native language, and that would explain perceived differences in argumentation and general communication patterns  across different languages. For me at least, speaking in my non-native language sometimes forces my thoughts to be more rational and organized, although the line is gradually blurring. </p>
<p>“In <em>An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding</em>, published in 1748, the Scottish philosopher David Hume reduces the principles of association to three: resemblance, contiguity in time and space, and causality.”</p>
<p>“Furthermore, only a few of the activated ideas will register in consciousness; most of the work of associative thinking is silent, hidden from our conscious selves. The notion that we have limited access to the workings of our minds is difficult to accept because, naturally, it is alien to our experience, but it is true: you know far less about yourself than you feel you do.” <br>
...and this makes self-discovery worthwhile and fun. </p>
<p>“&lsqb;...&rsqb;priming is not restricted to concepts and words. &lsqb;...&rsqb; you must accept the alien idea that your actions and your emotions can be primed by events of which you are not even aware.” <br>
(example: John Bargh, the “Florida effect”)<br>
“This remarkable priming phenomenon -- the influencing of an action by the idea -- is known as the ideomotor effect.” <br>
It’s scary to think about the possibility of people who understand this effect and apply it to manipulate others for their own gains...<br>
“The ideomotor link also works in reverse. &lsqb;...&rsqb; Reciprocal links are common in the associative network. For example, being amused tends to make you smile, and smiling tends to make you feel amused. &lsqb;...&rsqb; You can see why the common admonition to ‘act calm and kind regardless of how you feel’ is very good advice: you are likely to be rewarded by actually feeling calm and kind.”<br>
Yes, happy and positive emotion and expression are self-reinforcing. Somewhat similar to “fake it till you make it”. </p>
<p>“Money-primed people become more independent than they would be without the associative trigger. &lsqb;...&rsqb; Money-primes people are also more selfish. &lsqb;...&rsqb; The general theme of these findings is that the idea of money primes individualism: a reluctance to be involved with others, to depend on others, or to accept demands from others.” </p>
<p>“Feeling that one’s soul is stained appears to trigger a desire to cleanse one’s body, an impulse that has been dubbed the ‘Lady Macbeth effect’.” </p>
<p>“More important, you must accept that they are true about <em>you</em>. &lsqb;...&rsqb; You do not believe that these results apply to you because they correspond to nothing in your subjective experience. But your subjective experience consists largely of the story that your System 2 tells itself about what is going on. Priming phenomena arise in System 1, and you have no conscious access to them.” </p><h2>5. Cognitive Ease<br></h2>
<p>“&lsqb;...&rsqb; predictable illusions inevitably occur if a judgment is based on an impression of cognitive ease or strain. &lsqb;...&rsqb; A reliable way to make people believe in falsehoods is frequent repetition, because familiarity is not easily distinguished from truth. &lsqb;...&rsqb; If you cannot remember the source of a statement, and have no way to relate it to other things you know, you have no option but to go with the sense of cognitive ease.” <br>
无关紧要的言论这样就算了，但是如果是重要的言论，还是要靠system 2去检查验证的。</p>
<p>论如何写出人让人信服的信息<br>
前提: “It is entirely legitimate for you to enlist cognitive ease to work in your favor, and studies of <em>truth</em> <em>illusions</em> provide specific suggestions that may help you achieve this goal.”<br>
“The general principle is that anything you can do to reduce cognitive strain will help, so you should first maximize legibility.” <br>
“If you care about being thought credible and intelligent, do not use complex language where simpler language will do.”<br>
<ul>
<li>下面这段让我在飞机上笑傻了：“In an article titled ‘<strong>Consequences of Erudite Vernacular Utilized Irrespective of Necessity: Problems with Using Long Words Needlessly</strong>’, he &lsqb;Princeton Professor Danny Oppenheimer&rsqb; showed that couching familiar ideas in pretentious language is taken as a sign of poor intelligence and low credibility.”
</ul>
“In addition to making your message simple, try to make it memorable. Put your ideas in verse if you can; they will more likely to be taken as truth.”<br>
“Finally, if you quote a source, choose one with a name that is easy to pronounce.”<br>
当然这些都是在信息真实的前提下: “High quality paper, bright colors, and rhyming or simple language will not be much help if your message is obviously nonsensical, or if it contradicts facts that your audience knows to be true.”</p>
<p>难点在于“the sense of ease or strain has multiple causes, and it is difficult to tease them apart.” 但是希望还是有的，“Difficult, but not impossible.”</p>
<p>Speaking of cognitive ease:<br>
<ul>
<li>“Familiarity breeds liking. This is a mere exposure effect.”
</ul>
</p>
<h2>6 Norms, surprises, and causes</h2>
<p>“We are able to communicate with each other because our knowledge of the world and our use of words are largely shared.” <br>
所以世界观差太多的人交流困难啊🌝</p>
<p>“Finding such causal connections is part of understanding a story and is an automatic operation of System 1. ”<br>
“In fact, all the headlines do is satisfy our need for coherence: a large event is supposed to have consequences, and consequences need causes to explain them. We have limited information about what happened on a day, and System 1 is adept at finding a coherent causal story that links the fragments of knowledge at its disposal.”<br>
人总有make sense of things的天性啊。想起来以前和大学室友讨论的遇到一些麻烦的影响重大的事情有时候会需要rationalize。不过这些毕竟是自己给自己圆的故事，不能等同事实。</p>
<p>“The perception of intention and emotion is irresistible &lsqb;...&rsqb; Your mind is ready and even eager to identify agents, assign them personality traits and specific intentions, and view their actions as expressing individual propensities. ”<br>
人也总有把其他物品或者生物拟人化的倾向，细想觉得很神奇。</p>
<p>“&lsqb;...&rsqb; people are prone to apply causal thinking inappropriately, to situations that require statistical reasoning.”<br>
好好学统计概率，对于减少直觉判断的错误有帮助🌝</p><h2>7 - A machine for jumping to conclusions<br></h2>
<p>“System 1 is gullible and biased to believe, System 2 is in charge of doubting and unbelieving, but System 2 is sometimes busy, and often lazy.”</p>
<p><em>Confirmation bias:</em><br>
“Contrary to the rules of philosophers of science, who advise testing hypotheses by trying to refute them, people (and scientists, quite often) seek data that are likely to be compatible with the beliefs they currently hold.”</p>
<p><em>Halo effect:</em> <br>
“The tendency to like (or dislike) everything about a person -- including things you have not observed -- is known as the halo effect. &lsqb;...&rsqb; It is one of the ways the representation of the world that System 1 generates is simpler and more coherent than the real thing.” <br>
因为某个方面喜欢一个人，就会自动幻想他其他方面也是理想的样子。<br>
“The sequence in which we observe characteristics of a person is often determined by chance. Sequence matters, however, because the halo effect increases the weight of first impressions, sometimes to the point that subsequent information is mostly wasted.”<br>
所以说在还没有非常了解的时候就喜欢上一个人很多时候是随机事件，好像赌博一样，取决于先看到了这个人的哪一面。如果是好的一面印象很深，那么之后看到的不好的面可能就自动或者刻意忽视掉。</p>
<p><em>Bias reduction:</em><br>
“To derive the most useful information from multiple sources of evidence, you should always try to make these sources independent of each other.”<br>
“&lsqb;...&rsqb; before an issue is discussed, all members of the committee should be asked to write a very brief summary of their position. &lsqb;...&rsqb; The standard practice of open discussion gives too much weight to the opinions of those who speak early and assertively, causing others to line up behind them.”<br>
嗯，让每个人都能独立发声不受那些声音最大的人的影响，是很难却很重要的。</p>
<p><em>What you see is all there is (WYSIATI):</em><br>
“The measure of success for System 1 is the coherence of the story it manages to create. The amount and quality of the day on which the story is based are largely irrelevant.”<br>
很遗憾，现在很多生物学研究甚至发表也都是看故事的一致性。<br>
“It is the consistency of the information that matters for a good story, not its completeness. Indeed, you will often find that knowing little makes it easier to fit everything you know into a coherent pattern.”<br>
“They didn’t want more information that might spoil their story.”<br>
人经常选择性失明，只看到自己想看到的，只相信自己想相信的。拒绝看到事实，拒绝接收现实，也是自我防护体系吧？如果骗骗自己更容易，可以过的开心点，又何妨呢？可能是这样想的吧。</p><h2>8 How judgments happen<br></h2>
<p>“An underlying intensity allows matching across diverse dimensions.”<br>
最简单的例子是罪行和惩罚之间的对等。</p>
<p>“System 1 carries out many computations at any one time. Some of these are routine assessments that go on continuously. Whenever your eyes are open, your brain computes a three-dimensional representation of what is in your field of vision, complete with the shape of objects, their position in space, and their identity.” <br>
不知不觉大脑一直在对环境做3D建模，其实很神奇的，什么时候机器人可以做到这种程度就厉害了😎<br>
“In contrast to these assessments, other computations are undertaken only when needed: you do not maintain a continuous evaluation of how happy or wealthy you are &lsqb;...&rsqb;”<br>
“However, the control over intended computations is far from precise: we often compute much more than we want or need. I call this excess computation the <em>mental shotgun</em>.”</p>
<p>比如说<br>
“An intention to answer one question evoked another, which was not only superfluous but actually detrimental to the main task.”<br>
下面这个例子挺好玩的, 三句话让大家判断字面上的正误：<br>
<ul>
<li>Some roads are snakes.<br>
<li>Some jobs are snakes.<br>
<li>Some jobs are jails.
</ul>
“All three sentences are literally false. However, you probably noticed that the second sentence is more obviously false than the other two &lsqb;...&rsqb; The reason for the difference is that the two difficult sentences can be metaphorically true.”<br>
嗯尤其第三句😂</p>
<p>Speaking of judgment <br>
“Evaluating people as attractive or not is a basic assessment. You do that automatically whether or not you want to, and it influences you.”<br>
“This was a clear instance of a mental shotgun. He was asked whether he thought the company was financially sound, but he couldn’t forget that he likes their product.”<br>
是啊，这两点都经常发生🤣</p><h2>9 Answering an easier question <br></h2>
<p>这段话写的很好就全抄下来了<br>
“The normal state of your mind is that you have intuitive feelings and opinions about almost everything that comes your way. You like or dislike people long before you know much about them; you trust or distrust strangers without knowing why; you feel that an enterprise is bound to succeed without analyzing it. Whether you state them or not, you often have answers to questions that you do not completely understand, relying on evidence that you can neither explain or defend.”<br>
能意识到这一点就已经很好了，很多时候这些直观感受是很片面的不靠谱的🦆<br>
</p>

<p>Substituting questions <br>
“If a satisfactory answer to a hard question is not found quickly, System 1 will find a related question that is easier and will answer it.”<br>
“However,  lazy System 2 often follows the path of least effort and endorses a heuristic answer without much scrutiny of whether it is truly appropriate. &lsqb;...&rsqb; Furthermore, you may not realize that the target question was difficult, because an intuitive answer to it came readily to mind.”<br>
“&lsqb;...&rsqb; a judgment that is based on substitution will inevitably be biased in predictable ways.”<br>
要经常保持警惕，看看自己是不是做了替换，注入了偏见。</p>
<p>“The present state of mind looms very large when people evaluate their happiness.”<br>
这里他举了个很有趣的例子，一个实验表明下面这两个问题的顺序决定了它们的答案的相关性：<br>
<ul>
<li> How many dates did you have last month?<br>
<li> How happy are you these days?
</ul>
这个顺序导致相关性很高，反之很低～</p>
<p>“The psychologist Paul Slovic has proposed an <em>affect heuristic</em> in which people let their likes and dislikes determine their beliefs about the world.”<br>
是啊，喜欢的不喜欢的会影响世界观。</p>
<p>最后附上System 1的特点<br></p>
<img src="photos/ch9.jpeg" alt="Characteristics of System 1" width=400><h2>10 The law of small numbers <br></h2>
<p>“&lsqb;...&rsqb; extreme outcomes (both high and low) are more likely to be found in small than in large samples. &lsqb;...&rsqb; they are what scientists call artifacts, observations that are produced entirely by some aspect of the method of research -- in this case, differences in sample size.” <br>
“&lsqb;...&rsqb; ‘intuitions about random sampling appear to satisfy the law of small numbers, which asserts that the law of large numbers applies to small numbers as well.’ &lsqb;...&rsqb; recommendation that researchers regard their ‘statistical intuitions with proper suspicion and replace impression formation by computation whenever possible.’”<br>
做科研这点真真真太重要了。当然其他时候做判断也需要意识到这点。</p>
<p>“System 1 is not prone to doubt. &lsqb;...&rsqb; System 2 is capable of doubt &lsqb;...&rsqb; However, sustaining doubt is harder work than sliding into certainty. The law of small numbers is a manifestation of a general bias that favors certainty over doubt.”<br>
“We are prone to exaggerate the consistency and coherence of what we see. &lsqb;...&rsqb; System 1 &lsqb;...&rsqb; will produce a representation of reality that makes too much sense.” <br>
人总是喜欢确定性多于怀疑和不确定性。能用简单的故事和因果关系来和自己解释得通就会容易忽略真正事实的复杂性。</p>
<p>“Random processes produce many sequences that convince people that the process is not random after all.”<br>
“‘To the untrained eye,’ Feller remarks, ‘randomness appears as regularity or tendency to cluster.’”<br>
“The tendency to see patterns in randomness is overwhelming”<br>
“We are far too willing to reject the belief that much of what we see in life is random.”<br>
或许因为我们喜欢能够掌控生活的感觉～</p>
<p>最后总结太好了<br>
<ul>
<li>“The exaggerated faith in small samples is only one example of a more general illusion -- we pay more attention to the content of messages than to information about their reliability, and as a result end up with a view of the world around us that is simpler and more coherent than the data justify. Jumping to conclusions is a safer sport in the world of our imagination than it is in reality. ”<br>
<li>“Statistics produce many observations that appear to beg for causal explanations but do not lend themselves to such explanations. Many facts of the world are due to chance, including accidents of sampling. Causal explanations of chance events are inevitably wrong.”
</ul>
</p>
<h2> 11 Anchors <br></h2>
<p><code>[...] anchoring effect. It occurs when people consider a particular value for an unknown quantity before estimating that quantity. What happens is one of the most reliable and robust results of experimental psychology: the estimates stay close to the number that people considered -- hence the image of an anchor.”</code></p>
<h3>Anchoring as adjustment<br></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>“Amos liked the idea of an anchor-and-adjust heuristic as a strategy for estimating uncertain quantities: start from an anchoring number, assess whether it is too high or too low, and gradually adjust your estimate by mentally ‘moving’ from the anchor.  The adjustment typically ends prematurely, because people stop when they are no longer certain that they should move farther.”</p>
<p>“Nick Epley and Tom Gilovich found evidence that adjustment is a deliberate attempt to find reasons to move away from the anchor &lsqb;...&rsqb; Epley and Gilovich also confirmed that adjustment is an effortful operation. People adjust less (stay closer to the anchor) when their mental resources are depleted.”</p>
<p>🌰  “Insufficient adjustment neatly explains why you are likely to drive too fast when you come off the highway onto city streets -- especially if you are talking with someone as you drive.”</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Anchoring as priming effect<br></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>“My hunch was that anchoring is a case of suggestion. This is the word we use when someone causes us to see, hear, or feel something by merely bringing it to mind.”</p>
<p>“&lsqb;...&rsqb; suggestion is a priming effect, which selectively evokes compatible evidence. &lsqb;...&rsqb; System 1 understands sentences by trying to make them true, and the selective activation of compatible thoughts produces a family of systematic errors that make us gullible and prone to believe too strongly whatever we believe. &lsqb;...&rsqb; System 1 tries its best to construct a world in which the anchor is the true number.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>anchoring index = ( estimate| high anchor - estimate | low anchor ) / (high anchor - low anchor)  ---&gt; 一些研究实验表明此指标可以达到30%-50%并且有💰影响：<br></p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Powerful anchoring effects are found in decisions that people make about money, such as when they choose how much to contribute to a cause.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>anchor不需要有任何信息量<br></p>
<blockquote>
<p>“However, a key finding of anchoring research is that anchors that are obviously random can be just as effective as potentially informative anchors.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>容易被别有用心的人利用🌚<br></p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The psychological mechanisms that produce anchoring make us far more suggestible than most of us would want to be.” </p>
<p>加长版 “The main moral of priming research is that our thoughts and our behavior are influenced, much more than we know or want, by the environment of the moment. Many people find the priming results unbelievable, because they do not correspond to subjective experience. Many others find the results upsetting, because they threaten the subjective sense of agency and autonomy.” &lt;--- 我</p>
</blockquote>
<p>如何保护自己 🙅‍♀️<br></p>
<blockquote>
<p>“In general a strategy of deliberately ‘thinking the opposite’ may be a good defense against anchoring effects, because it negates the biased recruitment of thoughts that produces these effects.”</p>
<p>加长版 “You are always aware of the anchor and even pay attention to it, but you do not know how it guides and constrains your thinking, because you cannot imagine how you would have thought if the anchor had been different (or absent). However, you should assume that any number that is on the table has had an anchoring effect on you, and if the stakes are high you should mobilize yourself (your System 2) to combat the effect.”</p>
</blockquote><h2>12 The science of availability</h2>
<p><code>We defined the availability heuristic as the process of judging frequency by “the ease with which instances come to mind.”</code></p>
<p>除了频率，还有曝光度（例如明星离婚），戏剧性事件（例如飞机失事），个人经历。</p>
<p>要时刻保持警惕是一件琐事，但是做到这点可以促进夫妻关系以及其他合作项目🌝</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One of the best-known studies of availability suggests that awareness of your own biases can contribute to peace in marriages, and probably other joint projects.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>同理，也是因为availability bias大家经常容易感觉自己在合作项目中的实际付出比自己的分内之事要多，并且其他人没有足够的感激自己的付出。</p>
<p>他讲了一个很有趣的实验：1）实验对象被要求列出6个或者12个表现他们自己assertive的🌰，2）他们对自己的assertive的程度做出评价。结果是被要求列出6个例子的人对自己assertive程度的评价要高。而原因是这样的：因为大家发现自己要想出12个🌰比自己预期的还要困难很多（因为低估了回想这些🌰的困难程度），所以由此推断自己不是很assertive。<br>
同理如果被要求提供越多的论点支持一个选择，人们越容易对这个选择不自信。<br></p>
<blockquote>
<p>People are less confident in a choice when they are asked to produce e more arguments to support it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>但是有趣的是如果这些实验对象被告知背景音乐会影响他们都回忆的流畅程度，那么以上现象就不存在了。也就是说如果外界给了他们一个随便什么理由来解释他们不容易回想自己assertive的🌰，他们就安然接受了，不再受availability bias影响。</p>
<p>另一个实验表面当人们自身受到判断影响的时候，人们会更多考虑能想到的🌰的数量多少而不是想到🌰的难易程度。</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The conclusion is that the ease with which instances come to mind is a System 1 heuristic, which is replaced by a focus on content when System 2 is more engaged. </p>
<p>&lsqb;...&rsqb; people who let themselves be guided by System 1 are more strongly susceptible to availability biases than others who are in a state of higher vigilance.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>有很多情况可以让人更容易被availability bias影响，其中包括让人感到有权利：<br></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Merely reminding people of a time when they had power increases their apparent trust in their own intuition.</p>
</blockquote><h2>13 Availability, emotion, and risk</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>&lsqb;...&rsqb; (Paul) Slovic eventually developed the notion of an affect heuristic, in which people make judgments and decisions by consulting their emotions: Do I like it? Do I hate it? How strongly do I feel about it? In many domains of life, Slovic said, people form opinions and make choices that directly express their feelings and their basic tendency to approach or avoid, often without knowing that they are doing so. The affect heuristic is an instance of substitution &lsqb;...&rsqb; <br>

<br>The affect heuristic simplifies our lives by creating a world that is much tidier than reality.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>The public and the experts </h3>
<p><br>这里的讨论太精彩也太应景了，作者给出了两方面的看法，先说Paul Slovic。他不觉得风险是客观的：
<blockquote>
Human beings have invented the concept of “risk” to help them understand and cope with the dangers and uncertainties of life. Although these dangers are real, there is no such thing as “real risk” or “objective risk.”
</blockquote>
他认为风险评估取决于如何衡量，而这个衡量的决策是受结果如何影响的，也就是说，定义风险其实是执行权力。他还说：
<blockquote>
&lsqb;...&rsqb; policy is ultimately about people, what they want and what is best for them. Every policy question involves assumptions about human nature, in particular about the choices that people may make and the consequences of their choices for themselves and for society.
</blockquote>
可惜，很多人在做决定的时候连对自己的后果都不太考虑，更何况给社会给别人带来的影响了😏迎合个人偏好和恐惧，那还需要社会契约吗？需要政府吗？<br></p>

<p><br>下面Kahneman讲了另一个人Cass Sunstein的看法，很大程度上是和Slovic相反的。不同于心理学家Slovic，Sunstein是一个知名法律学者。他认为风险可以客观衡量。
<blockquote>
His view is that the existing system of regulation in the United States displays a poor setting of priorities, which reflects reaction to public pressure more than careful objective analysis.
</blockquote>
而且这也很不公平啊，发声最响的人会得到最多的注意力。而其他更重要更危机的需求反而没有得到足够的注意力和资源。
<blockquote>
He starts from the position that risk regulation and government intervention to reduce risks should be guided by rational weighting of costs and benefits, and that the natural units for this analysis are the number of lives saved (or perhaps the number of life-years saved, which gives more weight to saving the young) and the dollar cost to the economy.
</blockquote>
很心酸的想到意大利🇮🇹前一阵估计就在做这些计算，并且估计算的是life-years😞
<blockquote>
Sunstein came to believe that biased reactions to risks are an important source of erratic and misplaced priorities in public policy.
</blockquote>
尽管书中讨论的重点和举的🌰都是人们不理智的高估了某些事件的风险，但是放在当下的情形，反过来看，道理是一样的。<br>
Sunstein说人们似乎不是很擅长评估小的风险，要不无视要不过激反应。对于很大的风险，似乎人们也是一样的 =&gt;强行无视或者不理智的囤货/歧视。
</p>

<p><br>对于公共决策的影响的对比：
<blockquote>
Cass Sunstein would seek mechanisms that insulate decision makers from public pressures, letting the allocation of resources be determined by impartial experts who have a broad view of all risks and of the resources available to reduce them.
</blockquote>
确实过于理想化，但是我更赞同。
<blockquote>
Paul Slovic trusts the experts less and the public somewhat more than Sunstein does, and he points out that insulating the experts from the emotions of the public produces that the public will reject -- an impossible situation in democracy.
</blockquote>
说的没错，完全的民主体制下Sunstein的主张很难执行。但是我不认同下面这句话。保护人们的恐惧？不对，应该去加强普遍教育，尽可能少一点不理智的无脑言论和行为。
<blockquote>
Rational or not, fear is painful and debilitating (✓), and policy makers must endeavor to protect the public from fear, not only real dangers. (❌)
</blockquote>
</p>

<p>最后，活学活用，我很清楚我自己现在的观点完全受了availability bias影响 -- 眼下的疫情已经各地各层政府的应对政策。</p><h2>14 Tom W’s Specialty<br></h2>
<p>这一章是围绕着一个🌰展开的。Tom W是Kahneman笔下的一个研究生。实验对象被要求回答三个问题：<br>
<ol>
<li>排序Tom在读每个专业的可能性（给出了九个专业大类）；<br>
<li>读完一段由一个不一定可信的心理学家对于Tom的描述，排序Tom和每个专业的相似度；<br>
<li>再次排序Tom在读每个专业的可能性。</p>
</ol>
<p>Twist是，这段描述是根据典型的计算机系研究生🌚写的。结果是：对于第一问大家都是根据统计概率猜的，第二问大家是根据representativeness猜的，而第三问大家还是根据第二问答的，基本无视了回答第一问时考虑的基准概率。<br></p>
<blockquote>
Substitution was perfect in this case: there was no indication that the participants did anything else but judge representativeness. The question about probability (likelihood) was difficult, but the question about similarity was easier, and it was answered instead.
</blockquote>
如此通过representativeness得出的预测尽管常常有用
<blockquote>
... has important virtues: the intuitive impressions that it produces are often -- indeed, usually -- more accurate than chance guesses would be.
</blockquote>
比如行为看着友善的人很可能确实友善，年轻男性比年长女性更容易开车过猛。
</p>

<p>但是，representativeness也带来问题：
<ol>
<li>an excessive willingness to predict the occurrence of unlikely (low base-rate) events.
<li>insensitivity to the quality of evidence.
</ol>
应对办法就是时刻牢记Bayesian reasoning
<ol>
<li>Anchor your judgment of the probability of an outcome on a plausible base rate. <br>
<li>Question the diagnosticity of your evidence.
</ol>
</p>

<p>这个道理非常实际非常有用，我就经常提醒自己要时刻记住prior，也就是他说的base rate，不要被新的一个甚至不知道uncertainty的数据完全影响判断。不过确实很难，就像他说的<br></p>
<blockquote>
Don’t expect this exercise of discipline to be easy -- it requires a significant effort of self-monitoring and self-control.
</blockquote>
关于这一点，有趣的是另一个实验表明如果人在思考回答这些问题的时候被要求皱眉，那么被representativeness带偏的程度要低一些，因为皱眉提高了System 2的警惕性。不过这也就说明representativeness带来的偏见是由于System 2日常太懒了🌚
</p><h2>15 Linda: less is more<br></h2>
<p>又是围绕一个引起很大争议的🌰的一章：<br><br>
<code>Linda现在31岁，单身，直言，聪明。她以前学的哲学专业。学生时期很关注歧视和社会公正问题，并且参与了反核武器抗议。</code> <br><br>
看了这段介绍以后，实验对象被要求排序以下八个情形的可能性：<br>
<ol>

<hr>
看过之前的内容的都猜到了，这个实验的重点在于6和8：8是6的子集，概率不可能比6大。但是结果呢？大多数人认为8比6可能性更大。<br>
他们为了验证，更进一步改变实验，单独挑出6和8让实验对象无其他干扰项在两者之间二选一，结果还是一样。<br>
Kahneman和Tversky把这个叫做<strong>conjunction fallacy</strong>：
<blockquote>
&lsqb;...&rsqb; a conjunction fallacy, which people commit when they judge a conjunction of two events &lsqb;...&rsqb; to be  more probable than one of the events &lsqb;...&rsqb; in a direct comparison.
</blockquote>
这种谬论的成因他认为归结于人们喜欢圆满一致的故事
<blockquote>
The most coherent stories are not necessarily the most probable, but they are plausible, and the notions of coherence, <em>plausibility</em>, and probability are easily confused by the unwary.
</blockquote>
所以增加＊相关＊细节有时候会让人更加信服，虽然严格上降低了事件概率，比如洪水vs加州地震带来的洪水。

<br><p>另一个🌰是让大家比较两组碟子的价值，其中A组有几个破损的，但是完好的碟子比B要多，所以价值应该严格高于A组。虽然实验对象在比较时正确的回答A组价值高，但是实验对象在分别评估时，给出的估值A要低于B。原因似乎是因为大家喜欢用平均值（典型例子）来思考，可是价值是加和。简单来说
<blockquote>
System 1 averages instead of adding.
</blockquote>
</p>

<p>
还有一个🌰表明大家在思考具体频率的时候（vs概率），更容易避免落入这个谬论：
<blockquote>
&lsqb;...&rsqb; the frequency representation, as it is known, makes it easy to appreciate that one group is wholly included in the other.
</blockquote>
</p>

<p>
最后一些反思，时刻保持警惕，共鸣：
<blockquote>
The laziness of System 2 is an important fact of life, and the observation that representativeness can block the application of an obvious logical rule is also of some interest.
</blockquote>
</p>

<p>
有趣的是因为实验和发现引起太大争议（批评），Kahneman在章尾很苦涩的说
<blockquote>
&lsqb;...&rsqb; but I have come to accept as a fact of life that the norms of debate in social sciences do not prohibit the political style of argument, especially when large issues are at stake -- and the prevalence of bias in human judgment is a large issue.
</blockquote>
当他多年后遇到一个坚定的批评者问对方为什么揪住这点时，对方说因为有趣，并且说这个Linda问题吸引了这么多注意力，Kahneman有什么可抱怨的呢？🌚拜托，不是所有人都是attention whore好么🌚
</p><h2>16 Causes trump statistics<br></h2>
<p>对于概率估计，两种基本比率会被差别对待：<br>
<ul>
<li>Statistical base rates are generally underweighted, and sometimes neglected altogether, when specific information about the case at hand is available. 
<li>Causal base rates are treated as information about the individual case and are easily combined with other case-specific information.</ul>
这是因为我们习惯用典型例子(stereotype)来代表每个类别，虽然stereotype有时很错，并且会带来严重后果，但是我们必须正视这一点：
<blockquote>
&lsqb;...&rsqb; the psychological facts cannot be avoided: stereotypes, both correct and false, are how we think of categories.
</blockquote>

<p>
我们都知道stereotype的问题，这是个贬义词，大家在很多情况下都（正确的）努力避免stereotype。但是这里Kahneman说的很好，我们也不能因此就说避免stereotype是没有费用的，而是说我们愿意为了改善社会状况提高平等而付出这个费用的代价。<br></p>
<blockquote>
The social norm against stereotyping, including the opposition to profiling, has been highly beneficial in creating a more civilized and more equal society. <br>
Resistance to stereotyping is a laudable moral position, but the simplistic idea that the resistance is costless is wrong. <br>
The costs are worth paying to achieve a better society, but denying that the cost exists, while satisfying to the soul and politically correct, is not scientifically defensible.</p>
</blockquote>
</p>

<p>
接下来他讲了一个很有趣的故事。一个心理学教授给学生们讲了一个实验。<br><br>
<code> 简单来说就是一群16人在一起讨论，轮流发言，每个人单独隔断。其中一个人是卧底，他在某次发言时假装突发癫痫然后求助。结果只有4个人出来救他，6个人一直没动，还有5个人在这个发作的人窒息了才出来。</code><br><br>
之后教授给学生看了两个人的采访视频，很普通的内容（没有额外的人格信息）。然后让学生猜测他们会不会去救人。
</p>

<p>结果是学生一边倒的都猜测这两个人会去救人，尽管他们刚刚学过这个实验，知道救人的概率很小。所以他们完全忽视了基本比率的信息。<br>
实验本身就很有意思<br>
<blockquote>
The lesson students are meant to take away is that some potent feature of the situation, such as the diffusion of responsibility, induces normal and decent people such as them to behave in a surprisingly unhelpful way.
</blockquote></p>

<p>
但是更深一层的问题是，学生都白学了。怎么能让他们学到呢？也不是没有办法，要刺激惊讶到他们。统计数据是惊讶不到他们的。要用具体🌰来刺激他们，比如反过来先不告诉他们结果，让他们猜完以后告诉他们这两个人没有帮助救人，再让他们猜群体救人比例时就会猜的准多了。<br>
按照原作者Nisbett &amp; Borgida的话说: <br>
<blockquote>
Subjects’ unwillingness to deduce the particular from the general was only matched by their willingness to infer the general from the particular.
</blockquote></p>

<p>
所以，要改变长期的信念很难，尤其是人性相关的，或许大家都容易盲目乐观相信自己的天性善良吧～<br></p>
<blockquote>
But even compelling causal statistics will not change long-held beliefs or beliefs rooted in personal experience.
</blockquote>
</p><h2>17 Regression to the mean</h2>
<p><code>The correlation coefficient  between two measures, which varies between 0 and 1, is a measure of the relative weight of the factors they share. &lsqb;...&rsqb; whenever the correlation between two scores is imperfect, there will be regression to the mean. </code></p>

<p>Kahneman的第一个🌰是以色列飞行员训练，教官发现表扬奖励会降低飞行员的下次表现，而批评职责则会提高他们的下次表现。Kahneman指出
<blockquote>
What he had observed is known as <em>regression to the mean</em>, which in that case was due to random fluctuations in the quality of performance. &lsqb;...&rsqb; The instructor had attached a causal interpretation to the inevitable fluctuations of a random process.
</blockquote>
</p>

<p>
有趣的是他由此引申到了人生🌚
<blockquote>
&lsqb;...&rsqb; the feedback to which life exposes us is perverse.  Because we tend to be nice to other people when they please us and nasty when they do not, we are statistically punished for being nice and rewarded for being nasty.
</blockquote>
对于这段话我保留意见，我不觉得人性也是回归均值的随机过程🌚更像是强化学习的过程，更适合用因果解释🌚当然这也可能是我的System 1在试图诱导我。</p>

<p>关于天分和运气这两句很到位所以框起来
<br><br><code>
success = talent + luck
great success = a little more talent + a lot of luck
</code><br><br>
人们总喜欢用（错误的）因果关系来解释均值回归现象，Kahneman这里举了几个体育表现的🌰。虽然我大体上认同这个道理和现象，但是我不能完全认同这只是随机过程和运气：毕竟每次表现不是独立事件，历史很可能会影响未来 - 需要autoregression模型🤔</p>

<p>人们对于回归似乎很难理解，他又举了个好玩的🌰：
<ul>
<li>高智商女性趋向于和比她们智商低的男人结婚。<br>
<li>夫妻智商的关联性不是完美的。</ul>
这两句话其实本质是一样的，但是第一句明显听起来更有趣更容易引起话题🌝 如果夫妻智商关联性不是100%，那么数学上必然就会发生高智商女性嫁给平均智商比她们低的男性。当然，反之亦然。
<blockquote>
&lsqb;...&rsqb; our mind is strongly biased towards causal explanations and does not deal well with “mere statistics.”
</blockquote>
要时刻谨记这一点，因为在科学研究中人们也经常遇到这个问题。就连经验丰富的科学家也会害怕落入陷阱，得出不可靠的因果推理🌝</p><h2>18 Taming intuitive predictions<br></h2>
<p>预测性判断有两种方式：<br><ul>
<li>根据查询数据，精确计算，明确分析<br>
<li>根据System 1的直觉</ul>
后者又分两种：<ul>
<li>从大量技能和经验得来的直觉（比如医生，消防员等）<br>
<li>从heuristics得来的直觉，经常涉及下意识的替换问题</ul>
</p>

<p>
直觉预测容易有很大偏差：往往过于自信和极端。虽然修正过的预测依然会有错误，但是减少了系统性偏差，使得错误会更小。至于如何得到没有偏差的预测判断，可以遵循以下步骤：<ol>
<li> predict baseline<br>
<li> make intuitive prediction based on presented evidence<br>
<li> estimate correlattion / confidence of the evidence<br>
<li> arrive at intermediate prediction between baseline and intuitive response</ol>
大多数时候这样的结果是一个比较moderate的预测，因为很少会遇到我们能够百分之百相信直觉判断的时候。这个修正方式其实是近似正规的统计分析的～</p>

<p>当然，作为严谨的Kahneman，他指出了caveat，也就是这样修正直觉判断是System 2的工作，而且是很辛苦的工作🌚<br></p>
<blockquote>
The effort is justified only when the stakes are high and when you are particularly keen not to make mistakes.
</blockquote>
并且要注意改正判断有时候会让人生更加复杂～要根据目标来决定，因为有时候减少偏差不是最重要的，比如风投人士可能更要避免错过下一个谷歌而不是减少投资一个失败的创业公司带来的一点点损失 -- 在这些情况下极端预测是被偏好的。
</p>

<p>当然，我们在放弃减少偏差时最好要清醒的意识到这一点：
<blockquote>
However, we are not all rational, and some of us may need the security of distorted estimates to avoid paralysis. If you choose to delude yourself by accepting extreme predictions, however, you will do well to remain aware of your self-indulgence.
</blockquote>
或许这些修正措施最大的贡献就是让我们必须思考我们的认知的限度。</p>

<p>最后，结尾有句话很有趣：<br>
<blockquote>
We will not learn to understand regression from experience.
</blockquote>
学会这一点并且让它深入骨髓很难，毕竟不是通过个人经验积累的思考认知方式内化起来比较困难。就好像上一章提到的十九世纪英国科学家Francis Galton花了几年时间才说服自己子女身高和父母没什么关系，只是regression to the mean。</p>
<h2>19 The illusion of understanding <br></h2>
<p>Nassim Taleb在他的黑天鹅书中提到了<strong><em>narrative fallacy</em></strong>: how flawed stories of the past shape our views of the world and our expectations for the future.
Kahneman此处拿Google的崛起作为🌰<br>
<blockquote>
<p>Of course there was a great deal of skill in the Google story, but luck played a more important role in the actual event than it does in the telling of it. And the more luck was involved, the less there is to be learned.</p>
</blockquote>
这就是应了之前讲到的WYSIATI原则(what you see is all there is)，扎心了：
<blockquote>
<p>You build the best possible story from the information available to you, and if it is a good story, you believe it. <br>
Paradoxically, it is easier to construct a coherent story whe you know little &lsqb;...&rsqb;</p>
</blockquote>
<code>
Our comforting conviction that the world makes sense rests on a secure foundation: our almost unlimited ability to ignore our ignorance.
</code><br></p>

<p><strong>Hindsight bias</strong> 是由于1）我们在意外事件发生以后会很快调整自己的观点，2）我们很不擅长重建自己曾经的但是被改变了的知识和观念。说白了就是事件发生以前我们怎么想的在事件发生以后很难准确回忆。以色列的Baruch Fischhoff做实验显示<br></p>
<blockquote>
<p>If an event had actually occurred, people exaggerated the probability that they had assigned to it earlier.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hindsight bias会带来很多问题，比如在判断决策质量时容易关注结果而不是决策过程本身的好坏。这对于经纪人性质的决策人来说尤其不利，比如说医生--人们往往容易把坏的结果怪罪于他们，而并不把好的结果归功于他们，典型的<strong>outcome bias</strong> 。结果越沉重，bias也越大。这些bias会导致决策人寻求官僚方案，极度避免风险，但是这样的结果也是好坏参半。当然这些认知偏差也不全是使人规避风险，另一方面看也奖赏那些幸运的冒险者--a few lucky gambles can crown a reckless leader with a halo of prescience and boldness. 🌚</p>
<p>成功的秘诀？（spoiler：运气比较重要）<br>
很喜欢这句话，智慧勇气不一定成功🌚
<br><code>We all have a need for the reassuring message that actions have appropriate consequences, and that success will reward wisdom and courage.</code><br><br>

<p>Kahneman举的例子是商业的成败，最后总结如下：<br>
<blockquote>
<p>Stories of how businesses rise and fall strike a chord with readers by offering what the human mind needs: a simple message of triumph and failure that identifies clear causes and ignores the determinative power of luck and the inevitability of regression. These stories induce and maintain an illusion of understanding, imparting lessons of little enduring value to readers who are all too eager to believe them.</p>
</blockquote>
咳咳，感觉讲商业成功秘诀的书主要卖的是希望，如果说成功与否主要看运气，书是会卖不出去的😂</p><h2>Conclusions</h2>
<h3>Two selves <br></h3>
<ul>
<li>The central fact of our existence is that time is the finite resource, but the remembering self ignores that reality. <br></li>
<li>The remembering self’s neglect of duration, its exaggerated emphasis on peaks and ends, and its susceptibility to hindsight combine to yield distorted reflections of our actual experience. <br></li>
<li>We can determine only after the fact that a moment is memorable or meaningful. The statements “I will always remember...” &lsqb;...&rsqb; can be false, and often are -- even when uttered with complete sincerity.  🌚<br></li>
<li>The remembering self and the experiencing self must both be considered, because their interests do not always coincide.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Econs and humans <br></h3>
<ul>
<li>Rationality is logical coherence. Econs are rational by this definition, but there is overwhelming evidence that Humans cannot be. An Econ would not be susceptible to <strong><em>priming, WYSIATI, narrow framing, the inside view,</em></strong> or <strong><em>preference reversals</em></strong>, which Humans cannot consistently avoid. <br></li>
<li>Although humans are not irrational, they often need help to make more accurate judgments and better decisions, and in some cases policies and institutions can provide that help. <br></li>
<li>These claims &lsqb;above&rsqb; are in fact  quite controversial. Milton Friedman expressed this view &lsqb;that rational people should be free and responsible for taking care of themselves&rsqb; in &lsqb;his book&rsqb; <em>Free to Choose</em>.  <br></li>
<li>The assumption that agents are rational provides the intellectual foundation for the libertarian approach to public policy: do not interfere with the individual’s right to choose, unless the choices harm others 🙃.  <br></li>
<li>For behavioral economists, freedom has a cost, which is borne by individuals who make bad choices, <em>and by a society that feels obligated to help them 🙃</em>. The economists of the Chicago school do not face that problem, because rational agents do not make mistakes. Freedom is free of charge. <br></li>
<li>Thaler and Sunstein &lsqb;in their book <em>Nudge</em>&rsqb; advocate a position of libertarian paternalism, in which the state and other institutions are allowed to nudge people to make decisions that serve their own long-term interests.</li>
</ul>
<p>现在这个时候看这些评价真的很有共鸣😞</p>
<h3>Two systems<br></h3>
<ul>
<li>The attentive System 2 is who we think we are. System 2 articulates judgments and makes choices, but it often endorses or rationalizes ideas and feelings that were generated by System 1. System 2 also prevents many foolish thoughts and inappropriate impulses from overt expression. However, System 2’s abilities are limited and so is the knowledge to which it has access. <br></li>
<li>System 1 is indeed the origin of much that we do wrong, <em>but it is also the origin of most of what we do right</em> -- which is most of what we do.  <br></li>
<li>The acquisition of skills requires a regular environment, an adequate opportunity to practice, and rapid and unequivocal feedback about the correctness of thoughts and actions. When these conditions are fulfilled, skill eventually develops, and the intuitive judgments and choices that quickly come to mind will mostly be accurate. (或许AI还是有希望的🤔）<br></li>
<li>&lsqb;When System 1 employs heuristics&rsqb; the heuristic answer is not necessarily simpler or more frugal than the original question -- it is only <em>more</em> <em>accessible</em>, computed more quickly and easily. The heuristic answers are not random, and they are often approximated correct. And sometimes they are quite wrong. <br></li>
<li>System 1 registers the cognitive ease with which it processes information, but it does not generate a warning signal when it becomes unreliable. (我们需要confidence estimate！）System 2’s only recourse is to slow down and attempt to construct an answer on its own, which it is reluctant to do because <em>it is indolent</em>. Many suggestions of System 1 are casually endorsed with minimal checking. This is how System 1 acquires its bad reputation as the sources of errors and biases: <strong><em>WYSIATI, intensity matching</em></strong>, and <strong><em>associate coherence</em></strong>, among others, give rise to predictable biases and cognitive illusions such as <strong><em>anchoring</em></strong>, <strong><em>nonregressive predictions, over-confidence</em></strong>, and numerous others. <br></li>
<li>The way to block errors that originate in System 1 is simple in principle: recognize the signs that you are in a cognitive minefield, slow down, and ask for reinforcement from System 2. Unfortunately, this sensible procedure is least likely to be applied when it is needed the most. The upshot is that it is much easier to identity a minefield when you observe others wandering into it than when you are about to do so. <br></li>
<li>Ultimately, a richer language is essential to the skill of constructive criticism. Much like medicine, the identification of judgment errors is a diagnostic task, which requires a precise vocabulary. (aka这本书😄）</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
